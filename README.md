Datasets
The dataset described in this project is retrieved from kaggle.


Part 2: PyCaret 

Summary
In this assignment, we used PyCaret and Gradio to perform low code data mining. We had to find a kaggle dataset to provide output of the colabs of pycaret. We were instructed to use the full automl capabilities of pyCaret.
